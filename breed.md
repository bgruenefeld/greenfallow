> **Temperament is the keystone of the labrador. In our opinion the labrador should have a kindly nature, always willing to please, shows no sign of aggression, should have an inbuilt love of retrieving and a natural ability to hunt. If it has all these qualities then it is a labrador.** 
*Sandra and John Halsted*
